“Two Weeks Left”
Created by Anna Wu

Game Description:

“Two Weeks Left” is an end of the semester simulation adventure game. The player is a first year computer science student at Reed, in the last two weeks before the first semester ends. The player has a variety of characteristics, such as the need for sleep, hunger, currency, knowledge, happiness, and time remaining. The player has 336 hours (two weeks worth) of in-game time to acquire each of the four types of special knowledge and maintain 50+ levels of happiness in order to achieve a victory. The game is set on Reed’s campus, and the player must explore the campus to find activities they can do in different rooms and different characters/items they can interact with to increase their knowledge and happiness. However, as time continually passes, they lose more hunger and their need for sleep increases, so they must also manage those characteristics. If their happiness, hunger, or sleep is improperly taken care of, the player will cease to function and the game will end in a loss. 

Instructions: 

  Each of the four exams (derivatives midterm, calculus final, cs midterm, cs exam) drops the four required special knowledge items. They are located in the calculus lecture (in eliot) and the cs lecture (in vollum). 
	You must acquire enough knowledge through studying, doing homework, going to lecture, and other small ways to have the prerequisites required to do the first exams. 
	You must also maintain sleep (by sleeping on things every once in a while) and hunger (by cooking or buying food) periodically. You can increase your currency by calling your family in your dorm room. 
	 Finally, you must maintain happiness by doing a variety of activities throughout the campus (e.g. talking to characters, eating, room specific activities). 
	It is recommended that you begin by exploring campus and then carry out actions once you are familiar with the actions in each room and where everything is located. 
	If you need further clarification/command help, type “help” while playing. I had my friend test the game, they were able to figure out how to play with incredibly minimal instruction so it should be intuitive.


Notes for playing: 

Going to lectures has all the answers for each of the exams, use those to beat them
Homework drops random amounts of knowledge each time, spawns in every 10 rounds of time passing
I added cheat codes so you can reach the exams and other later-game features quicker without having to play the whole thing (ease for grading)
time <integer> — passes the specified amount of time in the game
buff – resets hunger and need to sleep
know – increases knowledge by +100
hap – increases happiness by +100
