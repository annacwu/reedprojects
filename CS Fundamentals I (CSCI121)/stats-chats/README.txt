In coding this project I also attempted to complete trainBetter, and planned on
completing chatBetter as well. However, I cannot at this moment figure out why
one aspect of my trainBetter code is not functioning properly (you can see
which part in the comment I left on it in the chats.py file). The trainBetter 
function almost completely works, except that it will not append a new list to the 
list of lists when making the trigrams if it comes across a new trigram. This part 
of the code works for bigrams, so I am struggling to debug it. Therefore, I was
unable to get to chatBetter and unfortunately do not have the time at my disposal
with which to continue working on this project. If I do come across time in the next
week or two it is possible I may come back to it and attempt to complete it since
I feel like I was on the right track, though those circumstances would be
outside of my own control. However, I'd like to note that the required part of the 
project is all complete and fully functional. 

Additionally, for some reason when I attempt to run chat.py on the cien_anos sample
text, it gives me an error about a list index being out of range that none of
the other sample texts do. I am not sure if this is an issue with my code or the
project code. Along with this, the sonnets text produces a strange output in which
it is analyzing the instructions rather than the actual text when I run chats on it. 
Again, not sure if this is an issue with my code or the pre-made project code. All
the other outputs for both stats and chats work as intended.
