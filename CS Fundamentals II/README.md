All homeworks and projects for CS Fundamentals II. Involves: 
  
  - Develop and evaluate informal termination arguments for programs with loops and recursion.
  - Evaluate claims of both asymptotic complexity and practical efficiency of programs by running tests
on different problem sizes.
  - Defend the use of abstractions and interfaces in the presentation of algorithms and data structures.
  - Identify the difference between specification and implementation.
  - Compare different implementations of a given specification and different specifications that can be
applied to a single implementation.
  - Explain data structure manipulations using data structure invariants.
  - Trace the operational behavior of small imperative programs.
  - Identify, describe, and effectively use basic features of C and C++.
  - Translate between high-level algorithms and correct imperative code.
  - Write code using external libraries when given a library interface.
  - Develop, test, rewrite, and refine code that meets a given specification or interface.
  - Develop and refine small interfaces.
  - Document code with comments and contracts.
  - Identify undefined and implementation-defined behaviors in C.
  - Write, compile, and test C programs in a Unix-based environment using make, gcc, and valgrind.
