1. What is your name (as it appears officially at Reed)?

Anna Wu

2. Is there anything we should know when addressing you?
(Pronouns? nickname?)

My pronouns are "they/she," meaning both of those pronouns can be used interchangeably.

3. In what year are you at Reed?

I am currently a freshman at Reed!

4. What is your major?  If you don't know yet, what are you considering?
(If you are interested in the Math/CS and CS majors, please let us know.)

I am a Computer Science major and that is the major I applied to when I applied to the college. 

5. Why are you taking this class?

I'm taking this class as a part of my major requirements, but more introspectively because I am very interested in programming and need to review what I've previously learned. 

6. Have you ever programmed before?  If so, how much? in what language(s)?

I have programmed before a little bit in Java, in which I coded a storage/retrieval system for my IB CompSci HL IA. However, it was only over the course of two weeks and I have not coded since. 

7. What was the output when you ran test.py?

8192

8. Is there anything else we should know?

I'm very excited to learn more about computer science! Even though I did it for four years in high school, the program was very underdeveloped so I unfortunately didn't retain a lot of the important information.
